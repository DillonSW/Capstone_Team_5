## Function

This subsystem's function in our design is to tie all of the subsystems together, providing appropriate power to each system. The power coming from the wall outlet will be sent through terminal blocks in our din rail. This 120VAC power will be sent to the PC, and will be converted to 24VDC and sent to the PLC and sensor subsystem.
