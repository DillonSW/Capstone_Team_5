## Lesson Learned Team 5

This document should have a section for each team member. Each engineer should respond to these:

* Reflect on the project, both technical and organizational. What went well? What didn’t go well?
* What unanticipated problems occurred?
* What would you do differently if you were to do it over again?
* What “best practices” have you identified?
* What words of wisdom would you pass on to future students?
* What new knowledge or skills did you acquire throughout capstone.
