## Lesson Learned Team 5

This document should have a section for each team member. Each engineer should respond to these:

* Reflect on the project, both technical and organizational. What went well? What didn’t go well?
* What unanticipated problems occurred?
* What would you do differently if you were to do it over again?
* What “best practices” have you identified?
* What words of wisdom would you pass on to future students?
* What new knowledge or skills did you acquire throughout capstone.

## Austin Sigg
1. Everyone had sufficient techinical knowledge or means to learn said knowledge required to sufficiently perform all design tasks in our Capstone project.  Organizationally we could have had a more solidified structure in the roles each of us had, like not having a designated hierarchy with a 'team captain' sometimes resulted in confusion on who's responsibility it was to do what.  Overall though the functionaility of our team through out this project did end up working well besides a few minor things not even worth mentioning.
2. The largest problems all came mostly from misunderstanding on what exactly was wanted in reports. A lot of time could have been saved for everyone if we more easily grasped and comprehended what information our signoffs, reports, and experiments should specifically be composed of.  One problem we did not expect was that our parts may not arrive on time or at all. 
3. I would have gotten ahead on signoffs far quicker so as to have ordered parts sooner. I would have written my signoffs to compose exatly what my supervisor wanted from them so as to waste less time. 
4. Its best for everyone to have their own tasks and responsibilities in the team, but at the same time for everyone to work on everything together so as to have as many minds as possible working on all parts of the project giving each their own perspectives and skills to be utilized.
5. Get ahead and don't get behind; if you get behind on your work then do everything to catch up to make up for the lost time. Communication is everything--with your teammates, with your supervisor, with your client, etc..  Have designated resposnibilties and roles for every teammember so as to avoid all confusion and pointing of fingers.
6. In capstone I gained greater social skills more than anything, such as becoming better at negotiating, working with teammates, and preparing and presenting information. I also became highly developed in base engineering skills that come from being faced with problem and problem and having to adapt and solve such problems.
