## Lesson Learned Team 5

This document should have a section for each team member. Each engineer should respond to these:

* Reflect on the project, both technical and organizational. What went well? What didn’t go well?
* What unanticipated problems occurred?
* What would you do differently if you were to do it over again?
* What “best practices” have you identified?
* What words of wisdom would you pass on to future students?
* What new knowledge or skills did you acquire throughout capstone.

1. Everyone had sufficient techinical knowledge or means to learn said knowledge required to sufficiently perform all design tasks in our Capstone project.  Organizationally we could have had a more solidified structure in the roles each of us had, like not having a designated hierarchy with a 'team captain' sometimes resulted in confusion on who's responsibility it was to do what.  Overall though the functionaility of our team through out this project did end up working well besides a few minor things not even worth mentioning.
2. The largest problems all came mostly from misunderstanding on what exactly was wanted in reports. A lot of time could have been saved for everyone if we more easily grasped and comprehended what information our signoffs, reports, and experiments should specifically be composed of.  One problem we did not expect was that our parts may not arrive on time or at all. 
3. I would have gotten ahead on signoffs far quicker so as to have ordered parts sooner. I would have written my signoffs to compose exatly what my supervisor wanted from them so as to waste less time. 
4. Its best for everyone to have their own tasks and responsibilities in the team, but at the same time for everyone to work on everything together so as to have as many minds as possible working on all parts of the project giving each their own perspectives and skills to be utilized.
5. Get ahead and don't get behind; if you get behind on your work then do everything to catch up to make up for the lost time. Communication is everything--with your teammates, with your supervisor, with your client, etc..  Have designated resposnibilties and roles for every teammember so as to avoid all confusion and pointing of fingers.
6. In capstone I gained greater social skills more than anything, such as becoming better at negotiating, working with teammates, and preparing and presenting information. I also became highly developed in base engineering skills that come from being faced with problem and problem and having to adapt and solve such problems.

1. I believe we had a good overall team layout, each of us having sufficient prior knowledge to tackle the project. I think not having a team leader in the structure complicated the team. By that I mean there was confusion on who exactly needed to tackle what problem and a recluctance to take orders from others. Although the problems occured, the structure without a designated leader did help the team in the matter of treating all as equal.  
2. I believe the largest problem during the project was the ablility to receive all orders on time. We received around 3 out of 70 parts ordered in total. This could have caused major issues if the recevied parts had not been the required vital system pieces. It was also a small issue that some teammates would sometimes not want to do work most likely due to a fact that they were graduating soon. Although this occured, other teams experienced more of an issue that our team.  
3. If I knew there would have been such an issue receiving parts, I would have worked ahead far sooner so we could have gotten as much as possible. It also took time to figure out an exact layout for the signoffs. Once we noticed a pattern in the accpeted signoffs, the team quickly finished the reamining.  
4. Although we are in a team, it was best to designate **exactly** what each member would work on and **exactly** when it was expected to be finished. This way of communicating allowed the members to quickly finish sections of the project.  
5. Stay ahead on signoffs. There is date-based grading and delaying one grade can affect all of them. If you stay ahead then the grades will not be a concern.  
6. I improve majorly on my communication skills, with our team actually being voted best presentation. I also learned how to code GUI programs and how to develop communication betwwen a computer and PLC.  

## Ryan Reed 
1.  I think our organizational efforts paid off very well. If we were working on something (signoffs, experimentation, etc.), we were almost always doing it together. I think this helped all of us gain a better understanding of all subsystems and allowed us to help troubleshoot problems as a team. Something that I believe didn't go well was making sure parts were ordered. I understand that issues can arise, but I think we could have stayed more consistent and thorough with checking on ordering.
2.  The biggest unanticipated problem that occurred was not receiving our parts, namely the memory card for our PLC. Because of this we had to use the PLCs in the Prescott labs and had to use Studio 5000 (Allen Bradley) instead of TIA Portal (Siemens). Also because of this we had to find a new way to create an OPC client in Python.
3.  I would have been more thorough in my signoffs, especially the highest priority signoff. I would have also asked for help from my teammates sooner. With the knowledge that I have now on how signoffs should be done, I was definitely not thorough enough in the beginning and I would have tried to add as much detail and reasoning as possible.
4.  Documenting **everything**. When working on a project this large and for this amount of time, everything should be documented, backed-up, and organized. There were numerous times that having every documentation neatly organized helped us complete a task trivially.
5.  Listen to Professor Roberts' advice on staying ahead. Capstone can (and most likely will) get very crunched for time near the end of the semester. Front-loading would be beneficial in allowing you to complete experimentation and documentation at a reasonable time.
6.  I gained a deeper understanding of topics that I was already interested in, and some new understanding of topics that I was not familiar with thanks to doing signoffs. The technical presentation also helped deepen and solidify my knowledge on tools that I might have to use when I'm in the industry.
